* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
* Business people and developer must work together daily throughout the project
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support their need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a developement team is face to facce information
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
* Simplicity - the art of maximising the amount of work not done

12. What are the Scrum Artefacts? What are their purpose?

* Product Backlog: The product backlog is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that must be completed for project success. It is essentially the team's to-do list, which is constantly revisited and reprioritised to adapt to market changes. The product owner maintains and updates the list, removing irrelevant items or adding new requests from customers.
* Sprint Backlog: The sprint backlog is the list of items to be completed by the development team in the current Sprint cycle. Before each Sprint, the team chooses which items it will work on from the product backlog. A sprint backlog is flexible and can evolve during a sprint.
* Increment: The increment is a step towards a goal or vision. It is the usable end product from a sprint. Teams can adopt different methods to define and demonstrate their spirit goals. Despite the flexibility, the fundamental sprint goal is what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint which cannot be compromised.

13. What are the Scrum Events? What are their purpose/goal? Who attends each one?

* Sprint Planning: In this event, the team estimates the work to be completed in the next Sprint. Members define sprint goals that are specific, measurable, and attainable. At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member knows how each increment can be delivered in the sprint.
* Sprint: A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. This may take 2 - 4 weeks.
Daily Scrum or stand up: A daily scrum is a short meeting in which team members check in and plan for the day. They report on work completed and voice any challenges in meeting sprint goals.
* Sprint Review: At the end of the spirit, the team gets together for an informal session to review the work completed and showcase it to stakeholders. The product owner might also rework the product backlog based on the current sprint.
* Sprint Retrospective: The team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what did not work during the sprint. Ideas generated are used to improve future sprints.

17. What are the attributes of an Agile team?

* Transparency: Teams work in an environment where everyone is aware of the challenges that others might be experiencing. Regular face to face conversations between cross-functional team members and project owners prevent miscommunication and information bottlenecks.
* Reflection: Frequent reflection point are built into the framework to allow team members to review their progress. Project managers use insights from these review meetings for estimation and future planning. As a result, projects can run more efficiently, wihtin budget, and on schedule.
* Adaption: Team members can reprioritise tasks based on changing customer requirements. They decide which tasks to complete first and which to revisit in the future.

Core values:
* Co-located
* Engaged with customers
